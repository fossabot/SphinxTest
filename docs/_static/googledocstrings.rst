Docstring Format
================

Back in the day, docstrings used used to be just plain
reStructuredText inside of docstrings.

* That was very gross.
* Even for google.

Solution
========

Google defined a non-gross docstring format that everyone accepts
and Sphinx recognizes.

* Sphinx needs an addon called "Napoleon" to interpret it.
* It is not a problem.

The code in :py:mod:`alpha` and :py:mod:`beta` utilize this Docstring format and are
automatically generated.
